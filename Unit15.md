**Unit 15: The Future of Mass Media** <span id="15"></span> 
*Perhaps the best way to consider the future of the media, the focus of
this unit, is to consider how it may affect you.  This unit wraps up the
course’s examination of where the media comes from by looking at where
it is headed, but you need to realize that most of it is speculation and
could change quickly as new or unexpected developments arise.  Indeed,
Internet security issues, which most of us have little awareness of, are
already having an impact, but because of the need for secrecy, it is
difficult to take those factors into account in predicting future
developments.  Other factors that can influence predictions about the
future of the media range from atmospheric conditions to technological
breakthroughs.  Nevertheless, your relationship to the media is not
likely to change very rapidly, and oftentimes you will be in control of
that change.  As you complete this final unit, review the material with
a heightened awareness of the power you possess over the media: the
power of choice.*

    Introduction to Mass Communication: “Episode 32 – Final Review” and
    YouTube: Gerd Leonhard’s “The Future of Media”**
    Link: Utah Valley State College: Phil Gordon’s *COMM 1500:
    Introduction to Mass Communication*: [“Episode 32 – Final
    Review”](http://desource.uvu.edu/videos/comm1500.php) (MP4) and
    YouTube: Gerd Leonhard’s [“The Future of
    Media”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEf6eYpRyo0) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Please watch these two videos, the first of which is
    a review of the final exam given in the televised class whose
    episodes you have been viewing throughout the course.  This review
    may help you remember important developments and issues which you
    covered in this class, but perhaps of more value is how it gives you
    the opportunity to say good-bye to the students and professors you
    have watched and, hopefully, enjoyed as you worked on this course. 
    The second video is a lecture presented by futurist Gerd Leonhard at
    Media Future Week 2011 in Almere, New Zealand.  Gerd Leonhard, a
    fellow of the Royal Society for the Arts in London, is also an
    author, scholar, and popular speaker whose expertise includes
    “digital business models, the networked society, a sustainable
    business ecology, social media and social communications, TV & Radio
    2.0, mobile content,” according to his website.  His YouTube speech
    brings up many interesting predictions about the relationship among
    and convergence of the media from an international perspective.  
      
     Watching these lectures should take approximately 2 hours and 30
    minutes.

**15.1.1 Electronic Games and Entertainment** <span id="15.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
15.1.  To appreciate the contents of this final chapter in the textbook,
consider the points the author makes about the future of these media and
then ask yourself, “What’s next?”  If you can’t come up with a
generalization about what might develop in the future, think about the
what you yourself would like to see develop, even if there are no
indications that it will.  Identifying your own wishes for the future of
the media may be more predictive that you think.  After all, chances are
that if you have identified a particular need, someone else has, too,
and may soon set about finding ways to satisfy it.*

*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit

**15.5.1 The USA PATRIOT Act: Weakening Privacy Laws or Protecting
Citizens?** <span id="15.5.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
15.5.  As you read this material, consider your own privacy needs and
expectations, both online and when you use (or are used by) traditional
media.  How much information about you do you feel is appropriate for
the government to know?  How much do you value your privacy verses your
safety?  If you were to debate this issue, how would you argue for or
against breaches in privacy rights for the sake of national security?*

**15.5.2 Social Networking: The Blurring of Personal and Professional**
<span id="15.5.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
15.5.  When you are reading this subsection, concentrate on how the
material involves freedom of expression as well as privacy.  When are
your personal opinions and private behaviors online reasonable to
associate with your professional life?  Try to identify the similarities
and differences between online and in-person attitudes and behaviors
outside of your job that could impact your position or employment.  Is
attending a political rally or participating in a parade which reflects
a lifestyle your employer disapproves of equally fair game for criticism
as posting a negative response to an online article or blog that
insulted or threatened that lifestyle?  Why or why not?*

**15.5.3 Restoration of Privacy** <span id="15.5.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
15.5.  As you complete this reading, put some extra thought to the value
of “https” as a way to protect your privacy.  Have you noticed its use
when you are online?  Does it reassure you?  Or is it something you
don’t notice when you are browsing or searching, perhaps because “https”
has not yet reached a level of usefulness for you personally?*

<span id="15.6.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
15.5.  Please pay particular attention in reading this material on
understanding the stages that mark the adoption and widening use of new
technologies, both on the individual and the societal level and
recognize examples from your own observations that illustrate the
process.*

**15.6.2 Mass Media Outlets and New Technology** <span
id="15.6.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
15.5.  As you complete your readings of the textbook, consider how new
technologies will adapt and expand in the future in the way the iPad,
iPod, and e-readers this subsection describes are experiencing.  Can you
identify other media-related technology which will or should branch out
into other areas of information dissemination or presentation?  If you
could invest in a company which had such an idea, would you?  Why or why
not?*
