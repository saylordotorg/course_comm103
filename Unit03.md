**Unit 3: Books** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit is the first of nine that focuses on a single media industry;
as a result, you will discover that each unit hereafter proceeds in a
very similar manner.  For example, you will notice how the learning
outcomes usually include similar objectives: learning the terminology,
recognizing the historical milestones, understanding the relationships
between the media and culture, comparing or contrasting formats or other
categories that divide the industry by the nature of its products,
identifying the leading products in the industry (bestsellers, top
grossing films, long-running television shows, etc.), and examining the
trends, issues, and future of the industry.  You may want to take
advantage of the parallel way the units explore these media industries
by taking notes in the form of a table or chart.  Instead of inserting
your notes on separate sheets of paper or note cards, consider instead
using a table with columns for each of the six common objectives and
rows for each of the nine media industries.  Such a table would make
studying for the final exam much more efficient and would also make
comparing the media industries easier.*  
    
 *In terms of what you will encounter in this particular unit, the
reality is that you will encounter a lot!  Books are one of the oldest
forms of mass media and as a result, they have a lengthy and influential
history and have played a significant role in the evolution of many
cultures.  They also typify the nature of media industries in that book
publishing offers many types of products that have influenced and been
influenced by the cultures and economies in their environment. 
Moreover, the book publishing industry is evolving as new technologies
impact how books are produced and also how they are consumed.  Tracking
the history of book publishing will illustrate to you for the first time
in this course the similar way all media industries begin, spread, and
change over the ages.*

     Instructions: Please watch both of these episodes by focusing on
    how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
      
     Watching these lectures should take approximately 2 hours.

**3.2.1 Books in the 1800s – How Uncle Tom’s Cabin Helped Start a War**
<span id="3.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
3.2.  Throughout your experience reading the textbook in this course,
you will encounter media products, like a single book or a single
television show, which had a profound effect on the media and/or on
society in the United States.  Because the United States has been a
leader in exporting media products, you may think that some of those
products must have had profound effects on other cultures, too.  It
would be valuable for you to consider that assumption more critically,
however, so ask yourself as you are reading about influential U.S.
publications whether they would or do have significance beyond the
culture which produced them.*
