**Unit 6: Music** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit looks at the first media industry the course will examine
that did not arise from the technology of the printing press.  The title
of this unit is based on the heading used in the textbook, but you
should realize that the actual subject of this unit is the recording
industry and also that music is no longer the only product that industry
produces.  Another way you can interpret that last statement, however,
is that not only will you see that the “music” industry has evolved over
the years, but what is recorded and even what is considered “music” has
changed, too – and those changes have always been driven by cultural
influences.  This marks another very important distinction among the
three print-based industries you have encountered in the previous units
and the audiovisual technologies that are the basis of the music, radio,
movies, and television industries.  What is that distinction?  The
audiovisual group has never been dependent on literacy.  As a result,
such industries represent the first, great expansion of mass media into
the lives of all classes of people and throughout the world.  That
statement may make you wonder why it is the “first,” since that word
implies a “second.”  The second expansion of mass media has stemmed from
digital technology.  You will appreciate the impact of the media on
culture and of culture on media even more if you keep in mind these
three important epochs in media history: the literacy-dependent era, the
audiovisual era, and the digital era.*

     Instructions: Please watch this episode by focusing on how the
    explanations and examples the program hosts and student guests
    provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular, listen for
    content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
        
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 1 hour.

establishes a causal relationship and that to have a relationship, you
need to also have at least two elements.  One element will always be the
record labels in this reading material, but it isn’t always clear what
the other element is.  Be sure you can identify what is being influenced
by the actions of the record labels.*
