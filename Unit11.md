**Unit 11: The Internet and Social Media** <span id="11"></span> 
*This unit examines the development and impact of the Internet and its
social media platforms on culture and society, subjects that seem to
come together in the Internet age to produce something both awesome and
troublesome.  However, you may appreciate these developments even more
if you consider that social media is not necessarily all that new. 
Before the printing press and widespread literacy, the public square,
the church, and the marketplace brought people, information, and even
entertainment together.  Even the increasingly segmented audiences and
participants in today’s social media have parallels from another time
when communities were smaller, centered on limited activities, and
controlled by viewpoints restricted by birth, faith, or station.  Thus
you may want to consider, as you work through this unit, that social
media may only be “new” in its technology, diversity, and reach; its
role in society and impact on cultures, however, reflect aspects of
human interaction that have been around for ages.*

     Instructions: Please watch this episode by focusing on how the
    explanations and examples the program hosts and student guests
    provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular, listen for
    content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
      
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 1 hour.

**11.2.1 Social Networking: Going Viral** <span id="11.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.2.  As you complete the reading, look back into your own past to
survey the development of social media in your own history.  When and
why did you decide to participate in it, or not?  And what about the
people around you: How widespread is social media use among your friends
and acquaintances?  And finally, how does your personal survey compare
with the observations in the textbook?  If yours differ, can you
pinpoint the reason?*

**11.2.2 Benefits and Problems of Social Media** <span
id="11.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.2.  Because the reading has maintained a focus on the relationship
between the media and culture, use the readings in this subsection of
the textbook to assess the role culture plays in the evolving benefits
and problems of social media.  Does social media have its own culture,
similar to the gaming culture encountered earlier in the course?  Or
perhaps your experience with social media illustrates that it is
unrelated to the culture of its participants.  Practice your analytical
skills by putting some thought to answering to these questions.*

**11.2.3 Education, the Internet, and Social Media: Privacy Issues with
Social Networking** <span id="11.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.2.  As you read this material, pay particular attention to why
privacy is a significant issue with the social media and then use
previous readings to pinpoint any other media in which privacy is as
important.  What is unique about social media and what does it have in
common with other media, especially with privacy issues?  Keep in mind
as you consider these questions that you are not always aware of when or
why information about you is being collected when you peruse the
Internet.*

**11.2.4 Social Media’s Effect on Commerce** <span id="11.2.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.2.  Once you’ve completed this reading, consider your own social
media encounters again.  Have you “liked” a business, for example?  How
do you traditionally encounter or use social media elements when you are
online?  When you need more information about a business, do you search
for its homepage or its Facebook page?  Do you follow any businesses on
Twitter?  Where does social media fit into your life as a consumer and
why?*

**11.3.1 Electronic Media and the Globalization of Culture** <span
id="11.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.3.  Of all of the subunits connecting the media to culture, this may
be one of the clearest examples.  As you read this material, pay
particular attention to how technology has made globalization possible. 
Make sure you can provide or recognize an example of that process in
action.*

**11.3.2 New Media: Internet Convergence and American Society** <span
id="11.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (11.3.2.1–11.3.2.3) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 11.3.  They are introduced
by major or minor subheadings in section 11.3 of the textbook.  As with
globalization, convergence through new media is readily apparent in
society, and not only in the United States.  Many would argue that
convergence is the economic model of the future for mass media.  Read
this material to identify specific support for that contention and also
to see if you can come up with arguments which weaken it.*

covered by the reading assigned for subunit 11.3.  They are introduced
by major or minor subheadings in section 11.3 of the textbook.  When you
read this subsection, pay particular attention to the definition of
social alienation and the examples that are provided.  Consider whether
it is a significant issue and look for information in the readings which
either support or weaken that perspective.*

**11.3.3.1 The “Internet Paradox” and Facebook** <span
id="11.3.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit

**11.4.1 Information Access Like Never Before** <span
id="11.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (11.4.1.1–11.4.1.2) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 11.4.  They are introduced
by major or minor subheadings in section 11.4 of the textbook.  To
absorb the information in this subsection most effectively, as you read
this material, think about your own access to information and also that
of your family and friends.  If you are older, consider how that access
has or has not changed and why.  If you are younger, consider what you
take for granted about information and what you would do if you couldn’t
use the access points you currently use.*

*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit
11.4.*

**11.4.2 Credibility Issues: (Dis)information Superhighway?** <span
id="11.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.4.  As you read this material, focus on the reasons as well as the
facts.  Why do credibility issues arise on the information
superhighway?  What motivations are behind disinformation and
misinformation?  Who are those strategies targeting and why?  And most
importantly, look for ideas that lead to solutions.*

**11.4.3 Wikipedia: The Internet’s Precocious Problem Child** <span
id="11.4.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.4.  Many students take Wikipedia for granted, which is why you should
pay particular attention to the material in these readings which explain
why you should not do that.  Make sure you can identify Wikipedia’s
disadvantages as well as its advantages and that you can identify the
alternatives that are available.*

**11.4.4 Security of Information on the Internet** <span
id="11.4.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (11.4.4.1–11.4.4.2) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 11.4.  They are introduced
by major or minor subheadings in section 11.4 of the textbook.  The
obvious question to ask yourself as you read this material is, “How
secure is my information?”  You should come away from reading this
subsection with a plan to insure that your information is as protected
as possible.*

**11.4.4.1 Hacking E-Mail: From LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU to Google in China**
<span id="11.4.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit
11.4.*

**11.4.4.2 Can’t Wait: Denial of Service** <span id="11.4.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit
11.4.*

**11.4.5 Net Neutrality** <span id="11.4.5"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (11.4.5.1–11.4.5.2) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 11.4.  They are introduced
by major or minor subheadings in section 11.4 of the textbook.  Pay
attention to the term “net neutrality” as you read this material.  As a
complex, far-reaching issue of increasing concern, net neutrality is not
an easy concept to absorb.  The best way to do so is to come up with
examples from your own experiences which illustrate the values as well
as the challenges it presents.*

**11.4.5.1 Net Neutrality Legislation: The FCC and AT&T;** <span
id="11.4.5.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit
11.4.*

id="11.4.5.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit
11.4.*

**11.4.6 Digital Technology and Electronic Media** <span
id="11.4.6"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
11.4.  As you finish reading this brief subunit, put more thought to the
one word that stands out the most: “free.”  Given what this subsection
is about, which type of “free” (free = liberty or free = no cost) is
being referred to and is it important to make the distinction?  Could
the other type of “free” be equally important?*
