**Unit 4: Newspapers** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the distinct influence newspapers
have had on human history due to their association with the
dissemination of news.  Although people get more of their news from the
Internet than from printed newspapers, throughout most of history,
newspapers were the primary source of news for most societies after word
of mouth.  As a result of this industry’s long-standing influence on
what people learned about the world around them, many media industries
that followed newspapers adopted the characteristics of news writing and
presentation.  To this day, journalism and newspapers remain closely
connected in the minds of many media consumers, although new forms,
activities, and styles of journalism also spread quickly once printing
presses and other technology increased the rate and decreased the cost
of newspaper production.  However, as you work through this unit, keep
one important feature in mind about newspapers: they require literacy. 
As a result, the generalizations about the influence of newspapers on
culture must be considered with a caveat because they are limited to
those cultures who could read.  Do not forget, as you read about the
history and impact of newspapers, that news and information were being
disseminated across cultures through other means as well and that those
means were equally important in the history of mass media.*

     Instructions: Please watch both of these episodes by focusing on
    how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.
