**Unit 10: Electronic Games and Entertainment** <span id="10"></span> 
*The author of this course’s textbook makes an interesting point about
electronic games, which you should appreciate as you work through this
unit.  The textbook notes how such games received a lot of criticism for
how they encouraged more sedentary entertainment habits, but they now
“have circled back to their simpler origins and, in doing so, have made
players more active.”  From Pong to Wii Fit, electronic games present a
breathtaking acceleration of technology and cultural influence that may
be unique among the mass media industries.  They also represent another
accumulation of features from other media, similar to television’s
development.  However, while many see television as having reached a
plateau in development and influence, gaming continues to reach into
more and more parts of life, well beyond mere entertainment.  You may
find the last section of this unit particularly intriguing as the focus
turns to what the future holds for gaming by emphasizing its potential
to merge with other communication and media formats to impact everything
from health to education to science and even manufacturing.*

**10.3.1 Game Culture** <span id="10.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
10.3.  As with popular video games, you may find the concept of game
culture to be very unfamiliar, especially if you are from a different
culture or generation than ones for whom games and gaming seem
ubiquitous.  Whether or not this is the case for you, it would be
valuable for you to compare game culture with other types of
activity-based cultures.  Can you think of any?  What about a tattoo
culture or a motorcycle culture?  Use such a comparison to cement in
your mind what is meant by “culture” in this context.*

*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
