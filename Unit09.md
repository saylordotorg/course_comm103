**Unit 9: Television** <span id="9"></span> 
*Television, and its many programming formats, can be considered to
represent an accumulation of several media industries into a single
product.  Almost from its inception, it included music, news,
advertising, literature, and other kinds of information and
entertainment that consumers had previously obtained through books,
newspapers, magazines, records, movies, and radio.  Of course,
television is much more than just a compilation of other media, and its
history and technological developments in many ways represent the
beginning of the modern era in general, especially as it evolved after
World War II.  Perhaps one of the best examples of how television
technology and cultural advances ran on parallel tracks was the Civil
Rights era, when people “of color” increasingly demanded more respect
and more influence.  Color television became mainstream technology
during this era as well, bringing with it a more vivid realism than
audiences had encountered previously – except in movie theaters and,
perhaps, in people’s imaginations.  However, movies were not an
important source of news and information, while television rapidly
evolved into a critical source, wielding an influence of such power that
it has been argued to have altered the national psyche of the time, a
chief instigator of far-reaching changes in society and politics.  As
you work through this unit, compare the historical influence of
television to what you may have experienced yourself with the Internet. 
See if you can recognize some similarities between television and the
Internet in terms of the impact their technical and content innovations
have had on the way people work, play, interact, and even think.*

     Instructions: Please watch all three of these episodes by focusing
    on how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
        
     Watching these lectures should take approximately 3 hours.

**9.2.1 Cultural Influences on Television** <span id="9.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (9.2.1.1–9.2.1.4) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 9.2.  They are introduced by
major or minor subheadings in section 9.2 of the textbook.  As you read
this material, keep in mind that television viewing was not widespread
until well into the 1980s, and so, early television was affected by a
relatively small and somewhat homogenous population.  As a result, a
more important question you should consider about this material is
whether and/or when television adapted to multiple cultures as its reach
grew or did the influence of its original, relatively homogenous
audience persist for a longer period of time than you would have
predicted and why?*

**9.2.1.1 Violence and Escapism in the 1960s** <span

*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit 9.2.*

**9.2.2 Television’s Influence on Culture** <span id="9.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (9.2.2.1–9.2.2.2) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 9.2.  They are introduced by
major or minor subheadings in section 9.2 of the textbook.  As you read
this material, keep in mind that television viewing was not widespread
until well into the 1980s, leaving early television to influence a
relatively small population.  The question is how did its influence grow
as the number of viewers increased and did that influence differ based
on the nature of its audience.  For example, as a larger and larger
population adopted the technology, did the shared experience produce
shared cultural traits, too, or was the experience filtered by those
cultural traits?*

**9.3.1 The Influence of Corporate Sponsorship – Public Television and
Corporate Sponsorship** <span id="9.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
9.3.  As you read this material, reflect back on the nature of corporate
sponsorship in earlier eras of television and see if you can identify
the cultural factors which have changed not only television but also its
relationship to companies which sponsor programming.*

*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (9.3.2.1–9.3.2.3) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 9.3.  They are introduced by
major or minor subheadings in section 9.3 of the textbook.  As you read
this material, make sure you are recognizing why network television
evolved as it did and keep in mind the changes which took place in other
media during similar periods in their history.  Look for similarities
which might help you predict future changes in the media.*

**9.4.1 The War between Satellite and Cable Television – The Current
Satellite Market: DirecTV versus Dish Network** <span

*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
9.4.  The long heading for this subunit reflects the way this material
uses the two satellite networks as proxies for combatants in the “war”
mentioned.  As a result, concentrate your attention on the way the two
satellite companies are similar and how those similarities enable them
to challenge the supremacy of cable television as a paid service.*
