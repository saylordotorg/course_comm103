**Unit 8: Movies** <span id="8"></span> 
*You should be noticing the order in which the units in this course are
being presented.  For example, you may have anticipated that television
would follow the unit on radio, but it does not.  It would be useful for
you to consider why this unit reviews the history and impact of movies
instead.  The reason is because it presents, like the music industry, an
element in the evolution of media industries in general, a relatively
isolated element that operated independently before it became enmeshed
in the operations of other media industries as well.  This original
independence in the movie industry was similar to the independence of
recorded music before the widespread adoption of broadcasting
technology, which enabled radio to include music as one of its
products.  You should appreciate on a broader level the way one industry
capitalized on another to attract wider audiences.  This course presents
these industries as you would encounter building blocks, starting with
the foundational media and then adding elements that were used as the
foundations of new media, a process that continues to this day.*

     Instructions: Please watch all three of these episodes by focusing
    on how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
      
     Watching these lectures should take approximately 3 hours.

**8.2.1 Movies Mirror Culture** <span id="8.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (8.2.1.1–8.2.1.6) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 8.2.  They are introduced by
major or minor subheadings in section 8.2 of the textbook.  Realize that
connections between culture and cultural artifacts like music are always
theoretical and rarely factual.  As you complete these readings, see if
you can spot causal relationships between movies and culture in the
readings which are stronger than theory because they can be directly
observed.  However, remember that correlation does not mean causation:
Just because one thing changes when there are changes in something else
does not mean that “something else” caused the change.  See if you can
apply some alternative explanations for why movies tend to mirror
culture, alternatives that do not include a strictly cultural
influence.*
