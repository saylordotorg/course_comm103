The purpose of this course, as governed by the textbook at its core,
*Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass
Communication,* is to complete a fairly comprehensive examination of the
evolution and impact of the media, primarily in the United States.  Each
of the major media (newspapers, magazines, books, radio, movies, music,
and television), as well as new media (electronic entertainment, social
media, and the Internet), are examined from their conception to the
present and future possibilities.  Emphasis is placed on how each media
industry has evolved over time, responding to changes in society,
technology, politics, and economics.  The course also explores the
cultural impact of the media, from individual media products to entire
industries, with particular emphasis on the cultural and ethical factors
that influence production, consumption, and also, due to the advent of
new media, participation.  Upon completing this course, you should be
more conscious of how your viewpoints are shaped by and can shape the
media with which you interact.  As a result, hopefully, not only will
you be more critical as a consumer of media products but also more
demanding and more creative as a participant and even a producer.

### Learning Outcomes

    major and new media industries.

### Course Information

Welcome to COMM103: Introduction to Mass Media.  Below, please find
general information on this course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** [P. Wynn
Norman](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#ProfessorPWynnNorman)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course primarily utilizes of the following
two resources:  

-   Readings: [*Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass
    Communication*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Understanding%20Media%20and%20Culture.pdf)
-   Lectures: Utah Valley State College: Phil Gordon’s *[COMM 1500:
    Introduction to Mass
    Communication](http://desource.uvu.edu/videos/comm1500.php)*

**Requirements for Completion:** To complete this course, you will need
to work through reading materials and lectures, as well as study
questions, critical thinking suggestions, and mini-projects, before
taking the final exam, which will be the sole basis of your official
grade.  
    
  In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam.  Your score will be tabulated as soon as you complete
it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately 75 hours
to complete.  Each unit in the course includes a “time advisory,” which
lists the amount of time you may need to spend on each subunit.  These
time advisories should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be
useful to take a look at these time estimates and determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set
goals for yourself.  Completing most of the reading assignments and
lectures in the units will take you between 3 and 4 hours, but the
amount of time it takes for you to respond to the discussion questions,
critical thinking suggestions, and mini-projects presented in the
subunits will vary depending on the nature and number of questions.  For
general planning purposes, however, you may want to set aside 5 hours –
the average time advisory per unit – for each unit.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** To absorb the material in this course and prepare
for the final exam effectively, use the learning outcomes listed at the
beginning of each unit to preview the information you need to look for
and focus on.  Moreover, do not just note the units and subunits that
the outcomes preview.  Recognize the demands on your critical thinking
skills which the verbs in those statements also indicate: compare,
contrast, describe, provide examples, critique, explain, recognize,
categorize, show, predict, identify, defend, justify, define, and so
forth.  
    
 In addition, you should recognize that the content of most of the
chapters in the textbook follows a similar pattern to review each media
industry: historical and technological developments are always covered
first, followed by the relationship between culture and the media,
important or influential media products, current issues and trends, and
finally projections about the future.  These patterns in the textbook
produce patterns in the units of this course, too.  This is another
characteristic you should look for in the unit learning outcomes and
also in the introductions and guiding statements presented at the
beginning of subunits.  Use the notes, study questions, critical
thinking suggestions, and mini-projects presented in the subunits as
additional guides to help you focus on important aspects of the readings
and study for the final exam.
