**Unit 1: Media and Culture** <span id="1"></span> 
*In the first unit of the course, you will learn about how culture and
the media have interacted with each other for many years.  The media is
both the product of and a producer of culture.  Appreciating that
relationship will help you both anticipate and understand how this
course is organized and the kinds of questions you should ask yourself
as you consider its contents.  For example, when it comes to problems
that may seem to stem from information or actions presented by the
media, how do you determine what actually causes those problems: the
media, which disseminates information about them, or the culture, which
creates or demands that information?  Answers to these questions may
become clearer as you proceed through this unit and learn about the
various roles the media plays in modern society and the individuals who
select and filter information for media consumers.*

    discussion qualities, and how the class will approach the
    relationship between the media and other influences in its history. 
    Be aware that the textbook and the lectures cover most of the same
    subjects, but the textbook uses cultural relationships as a common
    thread in each chapter, while the lectures do not use culture as a
    theme, focusing instead on the development, current state, impact
    of, and issues in the media.  A description of this focus is
    presented along with the course objectives at the 21-minute mark of
    Episode 01.

**1.3.1 The Modern Age – Modernity** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.3.  As you read through the subsection, keep in mind what you learned
about the media’s past and try to compare those traits and developments
with what the textbook identifies as the “modern” media.*

**1.3.2 The Postmodern Age** <span id="1.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.3.  Realize that there is no consensus on what is “modern” and what is
“postmodern.”  Because of that, you should read this material
critically, asking yourself whether you actually agree with the author’s
delineation or whether you think there might be a better way to
distinguish between the eras.*

**1.4.1 Kinds of Convergence** <span id="1.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This sub-subunit and the sub-sub-subunits beneath
(1.4.1.1–1.4.1.5) are covered by the reading assigned for subunit 1.4. 
They are introduced or highlighted by major or minor subheadings in
section 1.4 of the textbook.  This material presents the clearest
example of how the textbook often uses a term (“convergence”) as an
umbrella category for distinct but related subcategories.  Upon
completing this reading, you should be able to compare examples from
each subcategory.*

**1.4.1.1 Economic Convergence** <span id="1.4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This sub-sub-subunit is covered by the reading assigned for
subunit 1.4.*

*Note: This sub-sub-subunit is covered by the reading assigned for
subunit 1.4.*

**1.4.2 Effects of Convergence** <span id="1.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.4.  You should focus on how this material covers “effects” and connect
that treatment to its sister strategy, “cause.”  Throughout this course,
being able to identify causes and effects, especially with respect to
media and culture, will be a very important skill.*

**1.5.1 Free Speech as Cultural Value** <span id="1.5.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.5.  Understanding what both culture and values are is critical to
absorbing the important of this material.  One way to cement these ideas
in your mind is to relate them to your own perspectives.  What would you
describe as your culture?  What values do you associate with your
culture?*

**1.5.2 Persuasion and Cultural Values** <span id="1.5.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.5.  As with the previous section, this material presents a
relationship between two terms and the concepts they represent, but as
with many relationships, this one is not necessarily accurate or useful,
so you should apply critical thinking to the material you encounter.*

**1.5.3 The Cultural Value of Gatekeepers** <span id="1.5.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.5 and it requires you to use yet another term, “gatekeepers,” to
explain how people develop and apply value systems.  Considering your
own behavior, such as by identifying the gatekeepers whom you allow to
affect your own experiences, will help you absorb the details more
effectively.*

**1.6.1 “The Tastemakers”** <span id="1.6.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.6.  Make sure that you can distinguish between “tastemakers” and
“gatekeepers” once you have finished reviewing the material.*

**1.6.2 A Changing System for the Internet Age** <span
id="1.6.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.6.  The key to understanding the significance of this material is your
recognition of what a system is, something which the textbook takes for
granted.  If you look up the word, you’ll find several definitions.  It
would be useful for you to do so and then choose the one that fits the
context of the readings.*

**1.6.3 Getting Around the Gatekeepers** <span id="1.6.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
1.6 and is another instance where being able to describe examples from
your own experiences or observations would help you absorb the
information better.*

**1.7.1 Why Be Media Literate?** <span id="1.7.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (1.7.1.1–1.7.1.3) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 1.7.  They are introduced by
major or minor subheadings in section 1.7 of the textbook.  Notice, too,
that the subunit heading asks a question.  By the time you finish the
material, you should be able to answer it via a brief but insightful
statement which uses several of the terms introduced in the material.*

**1.7.1.1 Advertising** <span id="1.7.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and is covered by the reading assigned for subunit

individual accountability and popular culture.  Try to summarize how
popular culture can be influential and where in your own environment
individual accountability takes on even more importance.*
