**Unit 14: Media and Government** <span id="14"></span> 
*To truly understand the media and its role in society, it is necessary
to look beyond its history and development and into the other factors
that shape its actions and contents.  Throughout this course, culture
has had a central role in identifying why the media is as it is, but in
this and the two preceding units, the course has focused on other
influential factors.  Recognize, however, that those three factors –
economics, ethics, and government – vary in their influence based on
when in history and also where in the cultural mix of a country they
exist.  In the United States, freedom of speech and freedom of the press
are traditions that have played a significant role in the media’s
relationship with government, for example.  In other countries, that
relationship can differ widely.  As this course approaches its
conclusion, you should consider continuing to expand your understanding
of what the media is and can be by pursuing a comparative analysis of
other media systems.  This unit is a good springboard for that
exploration because it reviews the major agencies, legislative actions,
and political behavior that determine or are determined by the media in
this country, characteristics that can vary widely in other cultures and
political systems.*

    how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.
