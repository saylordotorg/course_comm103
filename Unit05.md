**Unit 5: Magazines** <span id="5"></span> 
*There is a reason why magazines follow newspapers in the order through
which you are encountering media industries: magazines and newspapers
have shared many traits, from their reliance on the technology of print
production and challenges involving distribution to their present
struggle to sustain profitable business models in the face of an
onslaught of competition from the Internet and a rapidly changing
environment due to digital technology.  One significant difference
between newspapers and magazines, however, has been longevity.  A day or
a week later, there was always a new newspaper, but magazines hung
around longer and were often passed from consumer to consumer.  The top
newspapers also retained, even to this day, a local or regional
grounding in their content and emphasis, while magazines, at least in
their heydays, became national and even international in their scope. 
As you proceed through the units of this course, begin to build in your
mind – or in the table of notes it is recommended you develop – the
significant differences in media, even when they rely on similar
technology and other production traits.  You will discover by doing so
that the differences you identify often reflect important
characteristics of the needs of media consumers and thus about their
cultures, too.*

     Instructions: Please watch both of these episodes by focusing on
    how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
      
     Watching these lectures should take approximately 2 hours.

**5.4.1 Format** <span id="5.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
5.4.  As you complete these readings, think about whether the traits
described produce information bias or information restraint and whether
bias and restraint are the same or different with respect to the
public’s access to information.  For example, is biased information
better than no information?  Are business decisions which restrain what
a magazine publishes also a form of bias?  Why or why not?*

**5.6.1 Online-Only Magazines** <span id="5.6.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
5.6.  As you read this material, focus on how online-only magazines
differ from print magazines.  Try to decide which type has the most
sustainable business model and why.  Keep in mind the role competition
as well as production costs can have on a publication’s viability and
consider visiting some of the sites discussed to compare their traits to
print magazines.*

**5.6.2 Magazine-Like Websites** <span id="5.6.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
5.6.  Use this reading to compare the original with its spin-off.  How
are magazine-like websites similar to and different from print
magazines?  Is the format equally transferable into a digital format? 
What important qualities are lost or gained when a reader can no longer
flip through the pages?  Consider visiting a few of the websites
mentioned in the readings to confirm your impressions.*

**5.6.3 Print Magazines with Online Presences** <span
id="5.6.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
5.6.  Please pay attention to how an online presence can enhance a print
magazine’s reputation and reach.  Are there any downsides to this
relationship?  Does it vary by publication?  If so, which ones and why? 
Remember, there is great value in applying concrete examples from your
own experience to the materials presented in the readings: You will
retain the information and use it on the final exam much more
effectively.*

**5.6.4 Is Print Dead?** <span id="5.6.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
5.6.  According to the British musical duo known as The Buggles, “Video
Killed the Radio Star.”  As you read the material in this section, focus
on what the author of the textbook and other theorists are claiming is
killing print media and also ask yourself whether it is the media itself
or just its medium (its format) that passes away.*
