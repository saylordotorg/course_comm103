**Unit 12: Economics of Mass Media** <span id="12"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the inner workings and justifications for mass
media, a very important unit since those elements determine the nature
of media as much if not more than cultural influences.  Moreover, given
how you have seen plentiful evidence of the way media influences
culture, you should view this unit and also the next two, which consider
the role of ethics and of the government in regulating products and
behavior of the media, as critical to your understanding of the power as
well as the threats that the mass media can represent.  If you are an
American, you may scoff at the idea that the media can be threatening,
but if you come from another culture, chances are you recognize that
already.  When economics rather than social need control a force that
has the power to influence opinion and change behavior, who controls
that force, how, and to what end should matter a great deal to you.  As
a result, you should work through this unit not only to understand the
business models and challenges faced by modern media but also to become
more familiar with the sometimes uneasy connection between profit and
people that the media also represents.*

    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.
