**Unit 7: Radio** <span id="7"></span> 
*This unit reviews the history of radio, but you might want to consider
that history as more of a bridge between what had been the role of media
in the lives of its consumers and what that role would become.  Radio
is, in many ways, the dividing line between elite forms of media,
products whose dissemination and use were limited by literacy or cost,
and popular forms of media, products that were easier and cheaper to
obtain and thus presented fewer restrictions on access.  The impact of
radio on the dissemination of news and information heralded significant
changes in society, too, although it would take time for different
cultures to exert equal influence.  Radio was also significant because
it used a limited public resource, the electromagnetic spectrum, which
required government intervention and regulation like no previous media
industry had.  However, while radio was the first, it was not the last,
and so you should keep in mind as you work through this unit that the
growing pains of radio as part of our culture continue to be reflected
in the evolution of other popular media formats that rely on limited
(and thus regulated) resources: television and the Internet.*

     Instructions: Please watch both of these episodes by focusing on
    how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
        
     Watching these lectures should take approximately 2 hours.
