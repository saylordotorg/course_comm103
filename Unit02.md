**Unit 2: Media Effects** <span id="2"></span> 
*It will be important as you work through this unit to recognize the
value of theory and research in framing how a subject like the mass
media is explored and explained.  Both are part of the scientific
process, which sets standards for how ideas become theories, which
produce hypotheses that can be tested by research methods that, ideally,
produce replicable and thus generalizable results.  Neither the textbook
nor the lecture spends a lot of time on the role science plays in
controlling and recording the results of research, but you should keep
that role in mind as you work through this unit.  You should also keep
in mind that research does not produce truth, theories are not
infallible, and no method is perfect.  However, there is value in
understanding where the generalizations you encounter about the nature
of media and culture come from, which is the focus of this unit.*

    of the following terms: propaganda, bias, stereotypes, cultural
    messages, new media, convergence culture, cultivation, and agenda
    setting.
-   Summarize theories on how media affects culture and explain
    hypothesized links among the media, violence, and sexual behavior.
-   Critique the application of theories on media agenda setting, uses
    and gratifications, symbolic interactionism, the spiral of silence,
    media logic, and cultivation analysis.

     Instructions: Please watch both of these episodes by focusing on
    how the explanations and examples the program hosts and student
    guests provide supplement the textbook readings.  In particular,
    listen for content which relates to the unit outcomes and take notes
    accordingly, especially when someone uses a specific example to
    illustrate a point.  Moreover, if you are not as familiar with
    American media as the textbook assumes you are, you might benefit
    from listening carefully to the discussions and then writing down
    the names of media, media personalities, or media products with
    which you are unfamiliar.  When you’ve finished watching, use the
    Internet to research any unfamiliar references so that you will be
    prepared if those references appear in the final exam.  
      
     Watching these lectures should take approximately 2 hours.

**2.1.1 Propaganda and Persuasion** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (2.1.1.1–2.1.1.3) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 2.1.  They are introduced by
major or minor subheadings in section 2.1 of the textbook.  As you read
this material, recognize that it is presenting another set of
relationships.  You should consider what type of relationship is being
described in each subsection of material.  Is it comparative,
predictive, restrictive, interactive, or something else?  You will
complete the reading knowing there are (theorized) relationships, but
will you be able to describe efficiently the nature of each
relationship?*

**2.1.1.1 Media Effects and Behavior** <span id="2.1.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit 2.1.*

**2.1.1.2 Violence and the Media** <span id="2.1.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit 2.1.*

**2.1.1.3 Sex and the Media** <span id="2.1.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned for subunit 2.1.*

**2.1.2 Media Effects and Behavior** <span id="2.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
2.1.  Please keep in mind that there are many factors which influence
behavior and the media is only one of them.  Consider determinants of
your own behavior and see if you can identify how the media might work
with other factors to compel you to act in a specific way.*

**2.1.3 Cultural Messages and the Media** <span id="2.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
2.1.  Throughout the textbook, cultural ramifications are emphasized,
but there is a problem.  The world is dominated by a multitude of
cultures.  The text focuses on the United States, a country of such
diversity that it is difficult to state with any definitiveness just how
cultural messages are produced or transmitted.  As a result, you’ll
appreciate the information in this subsection more by thinking about
cultures to which you do not belong and using the material to explain
what you’ve encountered when interacting with individuals from those
other cultures.*

**2.1.4 New Media and Society** <span id="2.1.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (2.1.4.1–2.1.4.4) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 2.1.  They are introduced or
highlighted by major or minor subheadings in section 2.1 of the
textbook.  You may or may not have access to an abundance of new media,
which may enhance or limit your appreciation for this subsection in the
textbook.  However, you are accessing this course through a platform
which invariably does expose you to some of the new media details in
this subsection.  What are they?  What do you encounter online which
reflects the relationship between new media and its impact on society?*

**2.1.4.1 Information** <span id="2.1.4.1"></span>

**2.2.1 Agenda-Setting Theory** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
2.2.  When reviewing media theories, it is important that you recognize
that they often compete against each other for the attention and respect
of scientists.  As you read section 2.2 in the textbook, ask yourself
how effectively each of the theories you encounter explain the media as
you perceive it.  Be prepared to criticize or defend these theories with
examples from your own experiences.*

*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
2.3.  To recognize the usefulness or inappropriateness of the research
methods covered in this material, consider how easily you could
generalize from their results and also consider the cost of pursuing
each method.  You should use these guidelines to prepare for critical

**2.4.1 Problems with Methodology and Theory** <span id="2.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit and the subunits beneath (2.4.1.1–2.4.1.5) are
covered by the reading assigned for subunit 2.4.  They are introduced by
major or minor subheadings in section 2.4 of the textbook.  If you
followed the guidelines provided for the previous subunits in this
section, you should be prepared to grasp the recognized shortfalls in
media theories presented in this material.  Make sure you are not,
however, allowing the weaknesses to override the usefulness of theory
for explaining the media and other complex systems.*

**2.4.2 Politics and Media Studies – Media Bias** <span
id="2.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
2.4.  As you review this material, work on coming up with examples of
media bias which you’ve encountered recently.  However, don’t stop with
recognition.  Ask yourself how bias can be reduced or avoided as well.*

**2.4.3 Media Decency** <span id="2.4.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
2.4.  It presents a term that is not widely utilized but which signals
an important concern about the media, particularly in the United States
but also in other countries.  Keep in mind, however, that “decency” is
still determined in the eye of the beholder.  Are there circumstances
described in the material which you would consider decent which the
author does not?  What cultural influences do you bring to your
assessment of media decency and indecency?*
