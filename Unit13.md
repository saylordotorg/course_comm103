**Unit 13: Ethics of Mass Media** <span id="13"></span> 
*Many argue that in a just world, business and ethics should go hand in
hand, that social responsibility is just as important as profitability,
and that the nature and pace of change should be tempered by costs other
than monetary ones, including the cost to the individual, not just the
group or mass.  Others argue that the objectivity and rationality of the
free market should play the preeminent role in determining how a
business operates.  As you work through this unit, it is important that
you keep in mind the cultural origins of ethics and how they can be
impacted by ideology and other factors, which can produce a murkier pool
of issues than is acknowledged by the various codes of ethics put in
place to guide the media and its representatives.  Nevertheless, anyone
working within or with the media should be aware of and prepared to deal
with ethical dilemmas and challenges.  Use this unit to understand some
of the issues that are out there and also to establish your own
perspectives on how they should be handled.*
